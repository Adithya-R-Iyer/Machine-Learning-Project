# Machine-Learning-Project
Big Hospital wants to help doctors do their job better shared data of past patients (a CSV file). We will deliver a model that predicts given the data
The dataset is a labeled and structured and has various clinical data
about the patient like cholesterol, ECG, heart rate, chest pain etc.
Our task is to build the model End to End and then provide a way for the doctors to access
our prediction model to assess new patients. **I have been Carrying out all the Assignments on the HEART-DISEASE-DATASET ('https://talentcocomedia.s3.amazonaws.com/ml-assets/heart-disease.csv') and simultaneously working on the TITANIC-DATASET ('https://talentcocomedia.s3.amazonaws.com/ml-assets/titanic.csv') just for practice sake.
